# VoiceDriven

This project is aimed to provide access of some softwares/solutions (youtube, google, etc.) via voice. 
Target platform is Raspberry Pi, however can be used on any platform. 
I am also planning to create different versions of this project for different platforms (Windows, Linux, Raspbian, Window IOT Core, etc.)
